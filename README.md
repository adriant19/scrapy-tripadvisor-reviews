# Scrapy TripAdvisor Reviews


#### DESCRIPTION
----------------

This project serves as an alternative to the BeautifulSoup + Requests web scraping technique that is widely used. Scrapy serves as a more efficient, and complete framework for web scraping and allows users to easily build a data pipeline for mass scale data extraction off of websites.

Some of the key features in this program include:

- Using selectors to extract key elements using xpaths.
- A follow through function for next pages of reviews.
- Export of data to csv in the desired format.
